# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x=int(input())
y=int(input())
z=int(input())
f = lambda a, b,c: a+b+c
print(f(x,y,z))
```

## Output

## Result
Thus,the Python program that defines a lambda function which takes two arguments a and b, and returns their sum is created successfully.
